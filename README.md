XedraWood: Stone and Sorcery

This mod acts as a compatibility patch for using Xedra Evolved and Innawoods together. It allows for three main things:

1) Playable Paraclesian starts Innawood, including a naked and afraid start.
2) Rework the drops from XE monsters so they don't have any modern technology.
3) Allow researching and gaining hedge magic Innawoods--deduction is renamed "occult" to fit the low-tech aesthetic.

I did not include the magic square hedge magic because some of its capabilities (summoning soldiers, summoning food) are much more powerful Innawood, and it doesn't fit the prehistorical theme the way killing a bear and wearing its skin to turn into a bear does.

This also will act as the core mod for several Xedra Evolved / Innawoods expansions; planned ones include: XedraWood: Eldritch Designs (magical tattoos using the CBM system), XedraWood: Toil and Trouble (using magical herbs and research alchemy), XedraWood: Mysterious Places (several new sword and sorcery themed locations to explore), XedraWood: Fell Beasts (monsters in the wilderness and their lairs), and XedraWood: Lost Magicks (learn more powerful spells, but that require correspondingly more powerful ingredients and time)

...theoretically.  We'll see if I get to all of those.
