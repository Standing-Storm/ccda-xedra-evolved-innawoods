XedraWood: Stone and Sorcery

This mod acts as a compatibility patch for using Xedra Evolved and Innawoods together, expanding further from the basic compatibilty performed by the base game. 

1) Allow researching and gaining hedge magic Innawoods--deduction is renamed "occult" to fit the low-tech aesthetic.

This also will act as the core mod for several Xedra Evolved / Innawoods expansions; planned ones include: XedraWood: Eldritch Designs (magical tattoos using the CBM system), XedraWood: Toil and Trouble (using magical herbs and research alchemy), XedraWood: Mysterious Places (several new sword and sorcery themed locations to explore), XedraWood: Fell Beasts (monsters in the wilderness and their lairs), and XedraWood: Lost Magicks (learn more powerful spells, but that require correspondingly more powerful ingredients and time)

...theoretically.  We'll see if I get to all of those.
