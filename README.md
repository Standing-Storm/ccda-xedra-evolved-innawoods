Xedra Evolved / Innawoods Bridge mod

This mod acts as a compatibility patch for using XE and Innawoods together. It allows for three main things:

1) Playable Paraclesian starts Innawood, including a naked and afraid start.
2) Rework the drops from XE monsters so they don't have any modern technology.
3) Allow researching and gaining hedge magic Innawoods.

I did not include the magic square hedge magic because some of its capabilities (summoning soldiers, summoning food) are much more powerful Innawood, and it doesn't fit the prehistorical theme the way killing a bear and wearing its skin to turn into a bear does.
